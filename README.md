## Overview

Honey production is a critical part of agriculture and biodiversity. This project aims to:
- Visualize honey production trends over time.
- Build and train a linear regression model to predict future production.
- Provide insights into future honey production through visualizations.

---

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/honey-production) and contains:
- **Year**: Year of production.
- **State**: US state where the honey was produced.
- **Total Production**: Total honey production in pounds.
- Other columns include the number of colonies, yield per colony, and price per pound.

You can download the dataset directly from Kaggle or place the file `honeyproduction.csv` in the `data/` folder of the project.
